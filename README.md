```sh
npm install https://github.com/filip-melka/blog-ui-library/releases/download/v0.0.2/blog-ui-library-0.0.2.tgz
```

```

## ðŸ“¦ Building and Packaging

To manually build and package the library, use the following commands:

## ðŸš€ Automated Publishing

The `publish-release.yml` GitHub Action handles automated building, packaging, and publishing of new releases.

### Releasing a New Version

To publish a new release, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your code is committed and pushed to the `master` branch:

```sh
git push origin master
```

2. Create and push a version tag:

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This triggers the GitHub Action to automatically build, package, and publish the new release.
